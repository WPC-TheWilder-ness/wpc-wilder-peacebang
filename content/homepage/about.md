You made it this far, or you skipped to the end. However the case, this is where I lay down a list of things to do, if you so choose to install your own World Peacebrain Mindeye (next-gen world piece computer).

In addition to resources and TODOs, I include a couple videos where I riff on hints, tips, insights, all based on my personal experience doing this from scratch, and with only a blank slate to draw lessons from.

My peace offering to you is simple: It is not just the thing, but also the host of mistake-lessons I have had to suffer deeply for. Perhaps one needs to make their own mistakes, but actually I think this is a deep-bullshit mantra we have fallen into valuing somehow as 'parental wisdom'.
